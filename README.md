# Tic Tac Toe Game

This is a simple implementation of the Tic Tac Toe game in Python. It allows two players to play the game on the command line.

## How to Play

1. Run the Python script `tictactoe.py` in your preferred Python environment.
2. The program will display an empty Tic Tac Toe board.
3. Player 1 will be prompted to choose their marker ('X' or 'O').
4. Player 2 will then choose their marker ('X' or 'O'). Note that Player 2 cannot choose the same marker as Player 1.
5. The program will randomly determine which player goes first.
6. Each player takes turns entering their desired position on the board (positions 1-9).
7. The game will check for a win or a tie after each move.
8. If a player wins, the program will display a congratulatory message.
9. If the game ends in a tie, the program will display a tie message.
10. After the game ends, the players will be prompted if they want to play again.
11. The program will continue to play games until the players choose not to replay.
